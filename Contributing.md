# Git Workflow
This project is a monorepo that uses lerna to link dependencies.

https://github.com/lerna/lerna

This mono repo should contain the commits from all of the packages.

Each package has it's own repo.

## Packages
Each package is in the packages directory. 

Code changes that touch multiple modules should be done on the ltzcore repo.
This way one branch can update multiple modules.

Lengthy developments on a single package should be done on that package's repo.
Once the package is at a good point, it should be merged into the monorepo

## Updating Packages From Their Own Repo
The monorepo packages can be updated via git subtrees, then submitted to the ltzcore repo as a MR

Example:
```
git co -b feature/ltzcore-node-update
git subtree pull --prefix=packages/ltzcore-node git@github.com:LitecoinZ-Community/ltzcore-node.git branchToPull
git push -u origin feature/ltzcore-node-update
# Create MR from origin:feature/ltzcore-node-update to upstream:ltzcore
```


## Updating Repos from Ltzcore Package
Changes to the mono repo can be pushed to the package repo.
```
git subtree push --prefix=packages/ltzcore-node git@github.com:micahriggan/ltzcore-node.git branchToPush
```

## Adding New Packages from Existing Repos
Packages can be added via Lerna or via git subtrees.

```
lerna import ~/somedir/path-to-ltzcore-repo --flatten
# OR
git subtree add --prefix=packages/ltzcore-repo-to-add git@github.com:LitecoinZ-Community/ltzcore-repo-to-add.git branchToAdd
```

This will merge all of the commits into the ltzcore history


# Dev Dependencies
Dev dependencies that are used on multiple packages can be hoisted to the top-level

Linters, formatters, and other standards can be defined top-level for the monorepo

This allows reuse of eslint/tslint/prettier standards for all projects.
